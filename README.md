Members can meet at those locations and play games together, either by using provided equipment or bringing their own set-ups. Game Space also collaborates with Partners ans Sponsors like game studios, equipment manufacturers and game magazines to offer access to equipment and exclusive events. The members can also take part in the community by writing reviews, offering help and creating content like walkthroughs to help other members.

  - The fonts used were taken from [Google Fonts](https.//fonts.google.com).

### Color

  - The base colour of dark blue and red was chosen in accordance to the content of the page and to simulate the feeling of old gaming devices which often used similar colours.
