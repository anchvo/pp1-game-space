# Game Space
The Game Space website is the online presence of a gaming community that offers meeting spaces for gamers in three different locations in Germany. Members can meet at those locations and play games together, either by using provided equipment or bringing their own set-ups. Game Space also collaborates with Partners ans Sponsors like game studios, equipment manufacturers and game magazines to offer access to equipment and exclusive events. The members can also take part in the community by writing reviews, offering help and creating content like walkthroughs to help other members. 

Users will find all necessary information on the website: An introduction of the community, events, locations and contact information, offered resources and examples and a sign up form for new members or partners. The site is targeted towards gamers that want to meet and interact with other gamers and likeminded people.
